# rust-by-example
I used the rust-by-example book to learn Rust

## What is this about

This is just where I tried the examples of the online tutorial rust-book ["Rust by example"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/).

## How is it structured

The `main.rs` executes each `section` of each `chapter`. The `lib.rs` exports all the `chapter` modules and each chapter exports all its `section` submodules. Each submodule has a `run` function that exposes the example.
